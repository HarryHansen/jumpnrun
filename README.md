This is a - hopefully - cool game. You control a character - a red square - through a parcour of platforms. Meanwhile, you have to collect some coins. 
When you've collected all coins, you can jump to the next level by a portal - a blue square.

This is a screenshot of the first level.

From level 2 on, there might be dark brown platforms. They break after your contact and respawn after a few seconds.
Since level 5, you can find buttons you can jump on to activate hidden platforms. 
All over the game, there are spreaded other power-ups, each marked by different colors with certain special effects. 
You'll even come across some hidden platforms you can't activate so you have to find them coincidentally. 
At a certain point, you can recognize more square - they're portals to teleport to the matchig portal. 

This game will be developed step-by-step, so you can report bugs and wishes for new features.
